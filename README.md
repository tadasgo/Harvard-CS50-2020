# CS50 Introduction To Computer Science

​	This repository contains solutions to all problem sets from [Harvard's University's CS50 course](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science "Link to that amazing course") of 2020. All of them scored 100% on submission.

​	This course is quite challenging. Made this repository to help other people who are struggling through it.  Feel free to use it, but remember try to solve as much of problem sets as possible by yourself. 

​	<u>Long hours spent trying to crack these challenges are the real treasure of this course.</u>

## What I experienced

​	I was amazed by the energy and passion of all three instructors, but mainly David J. Malan. He did an outstanding job explaining all the intricate details hiding behind the scenes of programming. It's a real great place to start if you are into Computer Science and software engineering.

​	All the tasks were challenging, but rewarding and interesting at the same time. Long hours spent trying to figure them out does add up and after a while I definitely felt much more comfortable while handling the code. Loved studying in Harvard for a whole month !
